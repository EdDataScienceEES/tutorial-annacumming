# Tutorial Planning

## Outline

I will combine the knowledge I have gained from this course as well as PCE, FE and EEA to design a tutorial which meets these aims:
* Understand the importance of considering your statistical analysis when creating your experimental design
* Learn which statistical tests apply to your dataset
* Learn about different linear models and their non-parametric alternatives
* Learn the assumptions of linear models and what to do if your data does not match them
* Use R to test your data matches linear model assumptions 
* Run a Spearman Rank Correlation test in R
* Interpret the results of a Spearman Rank Correlation test
* Be aware of the options for visualising the outputs of a Spearman Rank Correlation
* Learn the appropriate way to refer to the outputs of statistical tests in the results section of a scientific report


And covers the following topics:
1. Basics of Experimental Design 
2. Choosing a Statistical Test 
3. Linear Regressions and Their Assumptions 
4. Testing the Assumptions of Linear Regressions 
5. Transforming Your Data to Match Linear Regression Assumptions 
6. Non-Parametric Alternatives
7. Interpreting Your Results
8. Visualising a Spearman Rank Correlation (likely that this will also just be a brief description and some links)
9. Presenting Your Results 

In terms of how the tutorial becomes more targetted, it will begin with steps 1, 2 and 3 referring to all linear models, with more detailed descriptions of ANOVA and linear regression. Step 5 will refer exclusively to linear regression. Step 7 will refer to the Spearman Rank Correlation only. Step 8 will also. Step 9 will refer to linear models more generally.
