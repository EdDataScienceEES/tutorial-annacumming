# Data

IMPORTANT: Part of a practical written by Dr Kyle Dexter for the Ecological and Environmental Analysis course invovled using the same dataset to test the assumptions of a linear model and run a non-parametric test. A copy of that tutorial has been included in this repository under the name EEA_stats_practical for the sake of transparency. I have not simply copied this tutorial. I have edited both the code and narrative. I also included many extra elements as my tutorial has a different focus to that one.
