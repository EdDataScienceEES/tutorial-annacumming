# Spearman's Rank Correlation in R
### ***Exploring the link between experimental design, statistical analysis and the writing of scientific reports with a focus on linear models and non-parametric alternatives such as Spearman's rank correlation.***

This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of designing an experiment so that you can conduct the appropriate statistical test for the research question you have in mind. You will also learn about the different statistical tests, focusing on linear models and their non-parametric alternatives. You will use your R coding skills to test whether a dataset matches the assumptions of a linear model and learn what you can do if it doesnâ€™t. Having found (spoiler alert) that the dataset doesnâ€™t meet these assumptions you will use R once more to conduct a Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation test and find out how to present these results in a scientific report. <br />

This tutorial is aimed at coders who have done the following Coding Club tutorials (or equivalent, Iâ€™m not just here to advertise Coding Club ðŸ˜‰):

### Tutorial Aims

- Understand the importance of considering your statistical analysis when creating your experimental design
- Learn which statistical tests apply to your dataset 
- Learn about different linear models and their non-parametric alternatives 
- Learn the assumptions of linear regressions and what to do if your data does not match them 
- Use R to test your data matches linear model assumptions  
- Run a Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation and linear regression in R 
- Interpret the results of a Spearmanâ€™s Rank Correlation and linear regression 
- Create a plot to visualise the outputs of both statistical tests 
- Learn the appropriate way to refer to the outputs of statistical tests in the results section of a scientific report
